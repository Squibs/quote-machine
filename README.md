# Quote Machine

A random quote machine. Created while going through the front end frameworks projects at www.freeCodeCamp.org

**NOTE:** _I have multiple versions of this project. To View my non-React version of this project [go here](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/before-react). To view my React, sans-Redux, version of this project [go here](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/previous-react)._

_Completed April 19, 2018_

I have decided to re-create the only React project I had previously made.

I have done this project three times now on my path to learning web development. My first time, linked above ([and here](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/before-react)), was originally created as an _Intermediate Front End Development Project_ for freeCodeCamp. I later redid the project when I initially went through the _Front End Libraries Projects_ on the beta of freeCodeCamp ([previous-react version](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/previous-react)) as a project to learn React. I have now redone the project again, this time using React as well as Redux after a small break to relearn everything about React once again.

Before starting this project I delved into Webpack 4 to learn exactly what that was doing, and so that I knew what was going on in the background instead of using the create-react-app. I created two boilerplates while learning Webpack. The [first one](https://github.com/Squibs/static-site-boilerplate) is a boilerplate for static websites, which I created after doing my first paid freelance project. The [second boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate) is what I created after taking Stephen Grider's **Modern React with Redux** course on _Udemy_. It is a boilerplate for React/Redux projects, that I plan to adapt for myself as I do more React projects.

As I redid the React version of this project, I wanted to keep the same look, and just focus on the React/Redux side of things to really figure out what I am doing. I mostly feel as though I have learned quite a lot about Webpack, and still have a lot to learn about React and Redux. That knowledge will come as I continue to do more of the projects on the beta of freeCodeCamp.
