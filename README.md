<em>Completed June 1, 2017</em>

The first intermediate front end development project I completed while going through lessons on freeCodeCamp. This project features a simple setup of a area for a title, content, and a footer (for a source); and below that features two buttons: one to generate a quote, and another to tweet the currently displayed quote. This project uses the api of Quotes on Design in order to retrieve the content for the quotes that are displayed.
